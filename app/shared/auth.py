"""
Shared authentication dependency.

Validates uid and ensures session_id exists for every POST/PUT/PATCH request.
Mirrors the pattern in /chat/stream:
    uid = data["uid"]
    session_id = data.get("session_id") or session_manager.create_session(uid)

Attaches both to request.state so every endpoint can use them without
repeating the create-if-missing logic.
