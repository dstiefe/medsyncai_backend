Q&A v3 anchor-count survival filter.

Implements the rules locked in during the 2026-04-10/11 architecture work:

  1. LLM-first parser (in query_parsing_agent.py) extracts user intent and
     anchors against the closed vocabulary of synonym_dictionary.json.

  2. This module is the deterministic Stage D ("pull logic") survival filter.
     Given a set of recs or RSS/KG paragraphs from the routed section(s),
     it keeps only items that contain at least one canonical anchor and
     ranks them by the number of DISTINCT anchors matched (COR as
     tiebreaker for recs).

Core rules enforced here:

  - Generic English words are NEVER anchors. Only term_ids that exist in
    synonym_dictionary.json (or canonical concepts in intent_map.json
    concept_expansions) count.

  - Synonyms dedupe to their canonical term_id. If a rec contains both
    "SBP" and "blood pressure", that is ONE anchor hit (blood_pressure),
    not two. This is the rule the user called out verbatim:
    "SBP and Blood pressure are the same if they are both matched
    that's not 2 they count as 1 match".

  - Token-level containment, case-insensitive. No regex on clinical prose.

  - A rec survives with >=1 anchor. Ranking is by distinct-anchor count
    descending, then COR strength (Class I > IIa > IIb > III/no benefit
    > III/harm) as a tiebreaker.

  - A paragraph survives with >=1 anchor. Ranking is by distinct-anchor
    count descending. No COR on paragraphs.

The filter is deterministic, pure Python, unit-testable, and has no
LLM dependency. It is called by rec_selection_agent and by the pull
logic in qa_service BEFORE any LLM assembler sees the content, so the
assembler only receives content that actually answers the question.
