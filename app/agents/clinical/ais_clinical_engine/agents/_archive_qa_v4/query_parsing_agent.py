QA Query Parsing Agent — LLM-based question classification (Step 1).

This is the PRIMARY classifier for the Guideline Q&A pipeline.
The LLM reads the clinician's question with structured reference data
as context and returns a structured JSON with intent (44 intents),
topic (38 topics), anchor_terms as Dict[str, Any] (term → value/range)
grounded in reference vocabulary.

The LLM handles the probabilistic task (understanding clinical intent).
All lookup, retrieval, and matching is done by Python (deterministic).

Pipeline role:
    Step 1: THIS AGENT classifies the question
    Step 2: Python content dispatch reads intent → sources
    Step 3: Python routes to guideline sections (not yet implemented)
    Step 4: Python retrieves data from those sections
    Step 5: Focused agents process recs/RSS/KG
    Step 6: Assembly agent writes the answer
