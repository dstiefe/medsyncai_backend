    plausible but was never in its context — e.g. citing 6.3(3)
    when the retrieved recs were 5.3(3). Post-validate and strip.

    Strategy:
        1. Build the set of valid rec IDs from retrieved.recommendations
           (and semantic_units when they carry a rec id).
        2. Scan the summary for rec-id tokens (X.Y(Z) or X.Y.Z(W)).
        3. For each token whose ID is NOT in the valid set:
             - If wrapped in a parenthetical "(Rec X.Y(Z), COR ...)",
               drop the entire parenthetical.
             - Otherwise drop the bare "Rec X.Y(Z)" prefix, leaving
               surrounding prose untouched.
        4. Log every strip so the test harness can surface the bug.
