"""
Knowledge loader — single read path for guideline section content
and concept-section routing.

This module is the qa_v4 wrapper around the canonical guideline data
loader (app/agents/clinical/ais_clinical_engine/data/loader.py) with
three additional responsibilities:

1. Resolve `_alias_of` stubs transparently. When Stage 3 POINTER lands
   and legacy keys like "Table 8" become aliases pointing at
   concept section IDs, `get_section()` and friends will still
   return the merged concept section content as if the legacy key
   were still populated directly. Callers don't need to know
   whether a section is legacy or concept, stub or not.

2. Expose concept-section-aware helpers. `iter_concept_sections()`
   yields only the decomposed concept sections. `get_concept_section()`
   fetches a single concept section by id.

3. Serve the concept-section dispatcher. Given a parsed Step 1 query
   (intent + anchor_terms), resolve to the concept section IDs the
   query should fetch. The dispatcher uses:

     - `intent_to_concept_index`: intent → [concept_section_id, ...]
       computed at load time from
       ais_guideline_section_map.json['concept_sections'][*]
       ['supported_intents']. This is the inversion-of-control
       approach from the handoff doc Q3 — concept sections
       self-declare the intents they answer.

     - `routing_keywords` narrowing: within the candidate set chosen
       by intent, keep concept sections whose `routing_keywords`
       overlap with the query's anchor_terms.

     - Keyword fallback: if intent dispatch returns nothing, fall
       back to pure routing_keywords match across every concept
       section.

Intent dispatch + keyword narrowing is deterministic and auditable.
The Step 1 LLM parser does anchor extraction; this module does the
deterministic lookup. No LLM call inside dispatch.

Important design decisions (locked in the handoff):
- Flat snake_case concept section IDs (Q2 Option A)
- No anchor term catalogue (Q3) — LLMs extract anchors at query
  time, this module only matches them against each concept
  section's small routing_keywords set
- Single read path: content_retriever and response_presenter both
  import from this module. No other code path reads
  guideline_knowledge.json directly.

      - This function is responsible for DISPATCHING the LLM's
        structured output to concept section IDs. It does not read
        raw query text. It does not try to infer intent from keywords.
        It is a pure deterministic lookup on the inputs the LLM
        provides, using three layers:

          Layer 1 (intent): reverse index lookup → candidate set
          Layer 2 (anchor terms): routing_keywords overlap narrows

                                   thresholds are met by the patient's
                                   specific numbers

    Inputs:
        intent       — the intent name from intent_content_source_map.json,
                       determined by the Step 1 LLM.
        anchor_terms — clinical entity names extracted by the Step 1 LLM
                       and canonicalized via intent_map.concept_expansions.
                       Preferred form: dict where keys are terms and
                       values are the numeric/range values the clinician
                       supplied (e.g. {'INR': 2.5, 'platelets': 80,
                       'IVT': None}). List form is also accepted for
                       queries with no values.

    Returns an ordered list of concept section IDs, highest-confidence
    first. Empty list means either:
      - the LLM's intent does not correspond to any concept section,
      - or no concept section's routing_keywords overlap with any of
        the LLM's anchor terms.
    In either case the caller falls back to the legacy ranked search.

    Dispatch algorithm (deterministic, no LLM call):
      1. Intent → candidate concept sections via the supported_intents
         reverse index.
      2. Within the candidate set, score each concept section by
         routing_keywords overlap with the LLM's anchor term NAMES
         (word-boundary match, never substring).
      3. For each candidate, also check its anchor_thresholds list.
         When the LLM provided a numeric value for an anchor term
         that has a threshold rule, and the value crosses the
         threshold in the configured direction, boost that concept
         section's score. This is how the three-layer model's VALUES
         layer influences routing — a clinician's 'INR 2.5' lifts
         absolute_contraindications_ivt above relative_contraindications_ivt
         because 2.5 > 1.7 fires the severe coagulopathy threshold.

    # Concept dispatcher — semantic + intent scoring only.
    #
    # The concept dispatcher's job is to route a clinician's question
    # to the correct concept section. It uses two signals:
    #
    #   1. Semantic similarity (primary): cosine similarity between
    #      the query embedding and each concept section's pre-computed
    #      embedding. The concept section embedding encodes its title,
    #      description, routing keywords, and example clinician
    #      questions — its full semantic identity. This handles
    #      synonyms, polarity ("did not receive IVT" vs "received IVT"),
    #      and phrasing variation that lexical anchor matching misses.
    #
    #   2. Intent match (secondary): a boolean signal for whether the
    #      concept section declares the query's intent in its
    #      supported_intents. Not a hard gate — a strong semantic
    #      match can route correctly even when the LLM misclassifies
    #      intent.
    #
    # Anchor term matching is NOT scored at the dispatcher level.
    # Anchors belong at row/atom scoring within a dispatched concept
    # section — that's where specific clinical terms matter. Global
    # anchors like "IVT" or "stroke" here would light up every
    # IVT-related section and create false-positive routing.
    #
    # Value threshold crossings DO apply — they represent specific
    # clinical scenarios encoded in the concept section (e.g., INR
    # > 1.7 triggers absolute_contraindications_ivt) that a general
    # semantic match might not weight highly enough.
