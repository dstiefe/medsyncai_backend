"""
Assembly Agent — formats the final response from all search agents' outputs.

Responsibilities:
    1. VERBATIM REC ASSEMBLY — recommendation text is returned character-for-character,
       never paraphrased, never summarized, never blended across recs.
    2. SCOPE GATE — if no recs score above the confidence threshold, explicitly
       refuse rather than letting the LLM fill the gap.
    3. CLARIFICATION DETECTION — when top recs have conflicting COR values in
       the same section, present options instead of guessing.
    4. SUMMARIZATION GUARDRAILS — RSS and KG text may be summarized, but with
       strict rules: no invented numbers, no dropped qualifiers, no blending
       across recs' supportive text.
    5. AUDIT TRAIL — log every decision made during response assembly.

Rules:
    - Recommendations → VERBATIM, untouched
    - Supportive Text (RSS) → may be summarized (LLM)
    - Knowledge Gaps → may be summarized (LLM)
    - The LLM frames, it does not rephrase recommendations.

# ── Content Breadth ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Measures the TOTAL VOLUME of qualifying content the search retrieved.
# A vague question pulls back a lot of content — many recs, many RSS
# entries, across many sections or within a single dense section.
# A specific question pulls back focused content — 1-2 recs, 1-2 RSS.
#
# The content breadth score has THREE components:
#
# 1. Section spread: how many distinct section clusters have results
# 2. Rec count: how many qualifying recommendations were found
# 3. RSS count: how many supportive text entries were retrieved
#
# Triggers (any one fires → ask clarification):
#   - 3+ section clusters with qualifying recs (cross-section breadth)
#   - More than 2 qualifying recs (rec-level breadth)
#   - Large RSS volume supporting the recs (content depth)
#
# The follow-up message adapts:
#   - Cross-section: "Which area are you asking about?" → section options
#   - Within-section: "This section covers multiple scenarios" → rec options
#
# TOPIC_SECTION_MAP override: when the map resolved to ≤2 sections
# AND the content volume is low, trust the routing.

# Thresholds

IN_TOPIC_REC_THRESHOLD = 6      # ≥6 in-topic recs = dense section

# ── Narrowing qualifiers ──────────────────────────────────────────
# Terms that narrow a question to a specific clinical aspect beyond
# the topic keyword. Their presence means the user is asking about
# a particular parameter, timing, drug, or scenario — NOT about the
# entire topic. Used to distinguish "What is the tenecteplase DOSE?"
