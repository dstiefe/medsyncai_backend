"""
RSS Summary Agent — Step 5b of the Guideline Q&A pipeline.

Receives verbatim Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text (RSS) from Python.
Summarizes the supporting evidence relevant to the question.

RULES:
    - Summarize only. No interpretation, no paraphrasing, no outside knowledge.
    - Cut down volume to what's relevant to the question.
    - Preserve trial names, numbers, and clinical findings exactly.
    - If asked about evidence for rec X, focus on RSS entries for rec X.

Input:
    - The question + Step 1 JSON (intent, topic, search_terms)
    - All RSS entries from the resolved sections (verbatim from Python)

Output:
    - A concise summary of the relevant supporting evidence
