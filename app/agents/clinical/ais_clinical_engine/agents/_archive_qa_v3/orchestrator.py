"""
QA Orchestrator — coordinates the multi-agent Q&A pipeline.

Pipeline:
    1. IntentAgent: classify question, extract search parameters
    2. QAQueryParsingAgent: LLM-based variable extraction (async)
    3. Branching:
       - CMI path (criterion-specific): RecommendationMatcher ranks recs
         by applicability, same algorithm as Journal Search TrialMatcher
       - Keyword path (general/definitional): existing RecommendationAgent
    4. SupportiveTextAgent + KnowledgeGapAgent: run in parallel
    5. AssemblyAgent: combine results, apply scope gate, detect
       clarification, format verbatim recs + summarized RSS/KG

This replaces the monolithic answer_question() function in qa_service.py
with a modular, testable, multi-agent architecture.
