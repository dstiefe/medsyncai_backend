Knowledge Gap Summary Agent — Step 5c of the Guideline Q&A pipeline.

Receives verbatim Knowledge Gaps / Future Research text from Python.
Summarizes the gaps relevant to the question.

RULES:
    - Summarize only. No interpretation, no outside knowledge.
    - Preserve specific research questions and methodological gaps exactly.
    - If no knowledge gaps exist for the section, return empty string
      (the orchestrator handles the deterministic "no gaps" response).

Input:
    - The question + Step 1 JSON (intent, topic, search_terms)
    - All knowledge gap entries from the resolved sections (verbatim from Python)

Output:
    - A concise summary of the relevant knowledge gaps / future research needs
