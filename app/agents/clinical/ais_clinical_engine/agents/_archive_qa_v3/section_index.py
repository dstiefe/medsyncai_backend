"""
Section Concept Index — auto-generated reverse index from guideline content.

For each section, extracts all clinically meaningful terms from:
    1. Recommendation text (202 recs)
    2. Section titles
    3. RSS/supportive text

This gives the intent agent a data-driven way to resolve ambiguous
questions to the correct section, complementing the hand-curated
TOPIC_SECTION_MAP. When TOPIC_SECTION_MAP has a match, it wins (more
precise). When it doesn't, the concept index provides a fallback
that's still better than raw keyword scoring.

Architecture:
    - Built once at startup from existing JSON data
    - Pure Python, deterministic, no LLM
    - Returns scored section matches for a question
