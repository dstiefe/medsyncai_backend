Recommendation Selection Agent — Step 5a of the Guideline Q&A pipeline.

Receives ALL recommendations from the resolved sections (verbatim from Python).
Picks which ones answer the clinician's question.
Does NOT summarize, paraphrase, or interpret. Just selects.

Input:
    - The question + Step 1 JSON (intent, topic, search_terms)
    - All recommendations from the resolved sections (verbatim)

Output:
    - List of recommendation numbers that answer the question

    Rules (locked during 2026-04-10/11 design work):
      - Extract canonical anchors from the user's question against the
        closed vocabulary (synonym_dictionary.json + intent_map.json
        concept_expansions).
      - Generic English words are not anchors.
      - Keep a rec only if its text contains >=1 distinct anchor from the
        question.
      - Rank survivors by distinct-anchor count desc, COR strength as
        tiebreaker.

    Safety fallbacks:
      - If the question yields zero anchors (too short/generic), return
        the recs unchanged. The LLM selector will still see all recs and
        behavior matches the pre-v3 path.
      - If the filter drops every rec, return the recs unchanged and log
        it as a warning. Empty survival is a clarification trigger in the
        future, not a dead end here.
