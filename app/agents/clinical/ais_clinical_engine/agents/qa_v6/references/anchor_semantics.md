# Anchor Semantics — qa_v6 Pipeline Doctrine

Single source of truth for how anchor terms are interpreted in routing and
retrieval. If this document and the code disagree, the code wins — but
don't let that happen. Update both.

## The doctrine in one sentence

**Three independent signals — lexical anchor words, structured values/
ranges, and semantic meaning — each do the job they're best at. Lexical
never decides gate membership. Semantic decides "is this atom about
this concept?"; lexical adds bonus when exact words align; values/
ranges match structured clinical numbers.**

## The three layers

| Signal | Source field | Mechanism | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lexical anchor terms** | `anchor_terms` on atom | string / stem match | SCORE BONUS when exact words align |
| **Anchor values/ranges** | `value_ranges` on atom | numeric comparison | SCORE BONUS when structured numbers match |
| **Semantic meaning** | atom `embedding` | cosine similarity | GATE — is this atom about the query's concept? |

The gate is **semantic only**. The score rewards lexical alignment when it happens (via `W_PINPOINT` coverage) but doesn't require it.

Before this split, the pinpoint gate was lexical: the atom had to carry the query's tokens to survive. That produced the "we have seen lexical fail" cases:

- `"non-disabling stroke"` missed T4.3 because the token "stroke" is global (not in T4.3 anchors)
- `"mild deficit"` missed T4.3 because no T4.3 atom carries that exact token
- `"what defines X"` missed atoms that answer the concept without echoing the words

Moving the gate to pure semantic eliminates that class of miss. The anchor_terms field continues to do what it does well — word-finding for score bonus — without being the binary gate.

## Anchor tiers

Every anchor term in `guideline_anchor_words.json` is classified as one of
four tiers. Only two matter at runtime:

| Tier       | Role                                         | Runtime weight |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `pinpoint` | Discriminating clinical concept              | AND-gate       |
| `narrow`   | Treated as pinpoint                          | AND-gate       |
| `broad`    | Treated as pinpoint                          | AND-gate       |
| `global`   | Generic AIS term (stroke, IVT, AIS, TPA...)  | Tiebreaker     |

Terms not found in the tier map default to **pinpoint** — novel clinical
terms cannot be assumed to be global.

`GLOBAL_ANCHOR_TERMS` in [`scoring_config.py`](../scoring_config.py) is
the authoritative set of global anchors. Additions go there.

## Rule 1 — Pinpoint anchors are a conjunctive AND-gate

If the parser extracts any pinpoint anchors from the query, every eligible
atom must satisfy **all** of them. Missing even one pinpoint anchor forces
`score = 0`, which drops the atom below `SCORE_THRESHOLD` and removes it
from every downstream decision.

Rationale: a bedside clinician asking "what imaging do I need for stroke"
is asking about **imaging** in the context of **stroke**. A rec about
hospital organization (§2.9) that mentions "stroke" but not "imaging" is
not a partial answer — it is a different answer to a different question.
Partial match is not partial answer.

### What counts as "containing" a pinpoint anchor

Matching is against the atom's **anchor surface**, not just `anchor_terms`.
The surface is the union of:

- `anchor_terms` (the explicit list)
- tokens from `category` (underscores/hyphens split on — so
  `absolute_contraindication` contributes `absolute`, `contraindication`,
  and `absolute contraindication`)
- tokens from `section_title` (punctuation-split — so Table 8's title
  contributes `contraindications`, `absolute`, `relative`, `table`, etc.)

Matching also accepts simple plural/singular equivalence
(`contraindication` ≡ `contraindications`, `study` ≡ `studies`) and
multi-word anchor satisfaction (every word-token of a multi-word query
anchor must match some surface term by stem-equality).

This is the minimum needed to accept that a Table 8 row about aortic
dissection — whose explicit anchors are specific clinical conditions —
is still a valid answer to "what are the absolute contraindications".
The row's `category` is `absolute_contraindication` and its
`section_title` is the long Table 8 descriptor; the surface carries
both signals.

Enforced in [`retrieval._score_atom`](../retrieval.py) (the scoring
function). The gate runs before any score component is computed.

## Rule 2 — Global anchors count only WITH pinpoint or value signal

Global anchors (stroke, IVT, AIS, thrombolysis, alteplase, tenecteplase,
TPA, EVT, thrombectomy, endovascular thrombectomy, cerebral ischemia,
patient, patients) appear in nearly every AIS atom. Alone they cannot
discriminate — `stroke` trivially matches everything.

Global coverage contributes to the score **only** when the query also
brings:
- a pinpoint anchor (something to discriminate on), **or**
- an anchor value / range (a specific scenario to match against)

If the query is purely global, `global_cov` is silently zeroed. Semantic
similarity and intent affinity then drive ranking — anchor signal plays
no role.

Enforced in [`retrieval._score_atom`](../retrieval.py) immediately after
anchor coverage is computed.

## Rule 3 — Clarification clusters inherit the gate

The ambiguity detector in `retrieval._build_recs` clusters recommendations
that cleared `SCORE_THRESHOLD` and fall within `REC_TIGHT_BAND` of the
top score. Because Rule 1 gated every scored atom upstream, every rec in
a clarification cluster necessarily shares the full pinpoint anchor set
with the query and with each other.

Result: clarification options are always topically coherent — they
differ in **category**, not in **subject**. A clarification prompt never
mixes imaging recs with organization recs; it might mix "general brain
imaging" with "EVT advanced imaging" (both genuinely under §3.2).

## Rule 4 — Scope follows the user, not the query embedding

When the user replies to a clarification menu by clicking an option,
retrieval runs with `is_clarification_reply=True`. The ambiguity detector
is suppressed on reply turns: the user has already narrowed scope.
Re-triggering the menu would create a loop.

Enforced in [`retrieval.retrieve`](../retrieval.py) via the
`is_clarification_reply` parameter, passed by
[`orchestrator.run`](../orchestrator.py).

## Where each rule is enforced

| Rule | Component | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1. Pinpoint AND-gate       | retrieval.py   | `_score_atom` (early return on missing pinpoint) |
| 2. Global-only-with-others | retrieval.py   | `_score_atom` (zero `global_cov` when no pinpoint and no values) |
| 3. Cluster coherence       | retrieval.py   | `_build_recs` (inherits from Rule 1) |
| 4. Reply scope-lock        | orchestrator.py → retrieval.py | `is_clarification_reply` parameter |

## What the doctrine does NOT do

- It does not replace semantic similarity. Semantic is still the primary
  signal (`W_SEMANTIC = 0.40`). The gate simply removes atoms that are
  semantically close but topically wrong.
- It does not require every clinical term the clinician mentioned to be
  in the guideline vocabulary. Unknown terms default to pinpoint and
  gate accordingly — if the atom doesn't have the term, the atom is out.
- It does not replace value-based matching (CMI). Patient-scenario
  queries still route through `recommendation_matcher` for tiered
  matching; the anchor gate only affects which atoms the retrieval
  surface returns.

## Change log

- **2026-04-17** — Pinpoint AND-gate added; global-only-with-others
  added; documented. Previously, atoms scoring high on semantic alone
  (with a single shared global anchor like "stroke") could cluster
  into clarification menus with unrelated sections, creating noise.
- **2026-04-17** — Table rows migrated to hierarchical
  `parent_section` ids: `"Table 8"` became `"4.6.1.t8.absolute"` /
  `"4.6.1.t8.relative"` / `"4.6.1.t8.benefits-may-exceed-risks"`.
  Same pattern for Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Each row also gains a
  `section_path` breadcrumb for user-facing display
  (`["4.6.1", "Table 8", "Absolute Contraindications"]`). Topic map
  subtopic sections updated to match. `_topic_alignment_bonus` now
  recognises a Table 8 absolute-contraindication row as a descendant
  of §4.6.1, fixing a retrieval gap where contraindications content
  was invisible to the topic bonus.
