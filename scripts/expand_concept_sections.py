Stage 1 EXPAND — add concept section entries to the guideline database
and routing map.

This is the first stage of the concept section migration described in
the handoff doc. EXPAND is additive: new concept section keys are added
alongside the existing legacy keys (Table 8, Figure 3, etc.). The
legacy keys stay live as fallback until Stage 3 POINTER converts them
to _alias_of stubs.

What this script does:

1. Reads guideline_knowledge.json and extracts each legacy table/figure.

2. For Table 8, decomposes the 37 rows by their `category` field into
   three independent concept sections:
     - absolute_contraindications_ivt   (10 rows)
     - relative_contraindications_ivt   (18 rows)
     - benefit_outweighs_risk_ivt        (9 rows)

3. For each other ex-table/figure that has its own clean content
   (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and Figures 2, 3, 4), creates a single
   concept section that mirrors the ex-table content under a
   snake_case key.

4. Adds a top-level `concept_sections{}` dict to
   ais_guideline_section_map.json. Each entry carries:
     id, title, description, when_to_route, routing_keywords,
     supported_intents, parentChapter, sourceCitation

5. Does NOT touch the legacy "Table N" / "Figure N" keys in
   guideline_knowledge.json. Those stay live with their current
   content. They become _alias_of stubs in Stage 3.

6. Does NOT touch any retrieval code. That's Stage 2a (build
   knowledge_loader.py + dispatcher) and Stage 2b (flip preference).

Run with --dry-run to preview without writing.

Concept section ID inventory (from handoff doc, locked in Q2):
  absolute_contraindications_ivt     ← Table 8 absolute band
  relative_contraindications_ivt     ← Table 8 relative band
  benefit_outweighs_risk_ivt         ← Table 8 benefit band
  extended_window_imaging_criteria   ← Table 3
  disabling_deficits_assessment      ← Table 4

  angioedema_management_post_ivt     ← Table 6

  eligibility_algorithm_evt          ← Figure 3
  dapt_algorithm_minor_stroke        ← Figure 4

Table 2 (COR/LOE rubric) is NOT assigned a concept section. It's a
universal AHA reference rather than clinical decision content, and
has no direct clinical intent mapping.
